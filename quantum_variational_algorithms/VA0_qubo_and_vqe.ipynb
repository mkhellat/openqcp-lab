    "In this example, we used a predefined Two-Local circuit as the ansatz. It could be a useful exercise to checkout the Ising Hamiltonian for your problem, define your own ansatz circuit, and compare obtained results for different ansatz. In comparing different ansatz, the impact of the classical optimizer should not be underestimated! An optimizer should meaningfully suit the ansatz."
